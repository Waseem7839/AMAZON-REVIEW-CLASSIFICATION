# Amazon_review_classification.
Welcome to the Amazon Review Classification project! This repository contains code, data, and resources for building a machine learning model to classify Amazon product reviews into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.
The goal of this project is to classify Amazon reviews based on their sentiment or other attributes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing review texts, businesses can gain insights into customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
